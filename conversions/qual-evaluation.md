| Agnostic to how firmware images are distributed | No parts of the architecture assumes a specific suite of protocols or algorithms to ensure secure delivery of updates. The architecture does specify the usage of technologies such as certificates, asymmetric encryption, and authorization tokens, but these elements can be implemented in a wide variety of ways using different protocols, algorithms, and certificate/token types. The profiles provided in the thesis are examples of how specific incarnations of the architecture could look like. |
| Friendly to broadcast delivery                  | The architecture itself does not limit broadcast delivery and through correct usage of the manifest broadcasted updates will not be incorrectly installed by devices other than the intended recipients. Choice of technology can limit the usage of broadcasting, such as DTLS, but this is implementation specific. |
| Use state-of-the-art security mechanisms        | The architecture is based on asymmetric cryptography using certificates as well as access authorization through whitelists and possibly tokens for fine-grain authorization. Choice of key algorithms and token types will affect the cryptographic strength of the system, allowing for both smaller and less strong keys and tokens or larger and strong keys and tokens. |
| Rollback attacks must be prevented              | By specifying a monotonically increasing sequence number in the manifest, devices can make sure they are installing fresh images. Manifests are signed through COSE which ensures authenticity, an assailant would not be able to modify a manifest and then recompute a valid signature. |
| High reliability                                | This is an implementation specific requirement, however the storage element of the manifest aids in achieving safe storage of a new image. After a successful update, devices are to re-register at servers. No acknowledgment means the server knows the update still must be applied, thus an interrupted update can be redistributed. |
| Operate with a small bootloader                 | The thesis suggests to store an unencrypted image alongside its digest for the bootloader to be minimal, only needing support for calculating a SHA256 digest of the image at boot. All information about whether or not to perform the update is encoded in conditions in the manifest, and can be stored with small memory usage. |
| Small parsers                                   | The manifest format used in the thesis is simple, complete, and extensible. Parsing it requires storing the key/value pairs in predefined structures which is doable even with a very small parser. |
| Minimal impact on existing firmware formats     | The architecture makes no assumptions about firmware formats. It is up to the implementer to ensure the images are prepared for updating and that the bootloader contains the necessary functionality. Transporting the images is the same regardless of content. |
| Robust permissions                              | The architecture is based on asymmetric cryptography using certificates for identity and confidentiality, and whitelists of servers and operators as well as tokens for authorization. Different deployments have different security and performance requirements, the architecture is flexible by allowing different kinds of key algorithms, encryption schemes, and token types. Some deployments may not need tokens at all as authentication is done on a device level and whitelists are sufficient, white other deployments wanting to update specific pieces of a device may need fine-grained authorization through tokens. Different devices in the same deployment can have different authorization configurations, for instance by accepting different types of tokens. |
| Operating modes                                 | The architecture supports the device initiated pull model as well as the operator initiated push model. The update server acts as a mediator between device and operator as well as a repository for images and device profiles, letting the operator query the server for device statuses and devices query for updates depending on the model used. |

  

| Requirement                                    | Motivation                                                   |

| Installation instructions                      | Installation instructions or any sort of directive is not included in the base manifest structure but can be implemented in the options field. Directives, shown as an option in Figure~\ref{fig:manifest-format}, could be used to indicate decompression algorithms, preparation of bootloader etc while other more specific instructions can be implemented either as a directive or a new kind of option element specific to that deployment. |
| Override non-critical manifest elements        | The proposed manifest format has the critical elements as a baseline and the rest severed into the options field. Defining new option types allows for new elements in the manifest, but the devices need to be updated for their parsers and manifest checkers to be aware of the new elements. |
| Modular update                                 | Supported through precursor images, dependencies, URI aliases, and the use of authorization tokens for more granular updates. For devices with several MCUs and applications, possibly several operating systems, update access can be controlled through authorization tokens such that a vendor can only update their respective part. |
| Multiple authorizations                        | Enforced via operator and update server whitelists and authorization tokens. |
| Multiple payload formats                       | The architecture and manifest format does not make assumptions about the payload formats. The mappings of formats to keys in the manifest is deployment specific and whatever formats a deployment might opt to use can be represented in the manifest together with a SHA256 digest of said format. |
| Prevent confidential information disclosure    | The architecture is based on state-of-the-art security mechanisms and achieves confidentiality through asymmetric cryptography. Both manifest and payload are encrypted and then signed using COSE. |
| Prevent devices from unpacking unknown formats | Supported through the use of the manifest format element, preconditions, overridable/custom directives, and letting the update server decide if there is a suitable update for a device by matching against its registered profile. |
| Specify version numbers of target firmware     | Since devices are required to register their version alongside vendor and class ID, operators can query device statutes from the update server and then prepare updates matching these categories of devices. |
| Enable devices to choose between images        | Several images can be specified in a single manifest through the use of either precursors, dependencies, URIs (mirror list), or aliases depending on the specific use case. New options can also be defined capturing this behaviour, such as a new option providing URL/Digest pairs intended for parallel storage. |
| Secure boot using manifests                    | The thesis has not examined bootloaders, thus this requirement is out of scope. Investigating secure bootloaders could be part of future work in the topic. |
| Decompress on load                             | This behaviour can be encoded in the payload format of the manifest, or through the use of a custom directive indicating a compressed payload is stored. |
| Payload in manifest                            | Can be added as the optional "payload" element, the value would be the data of the payload and the regular payloadInfo element would contain its digest. Worth noting is that for most deployments including the payload in the manifest will dramatically increase the size of manifest, thus a manifest parser must be prepared for it. |
| Simple parsing                                 | As explained in the previous section, the manifest format is simple and easy to parse even for constrained devices. |
