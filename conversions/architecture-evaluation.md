- Agnostic to how firmware images are distributed:
  - The architecture does not make assumptions on underlying transport. The thesis gives examples of two different profiles using different means of transport.
- Friendly to broadcast delivery:
  - Nothing in the architecture prevents broadcasting, however choice of security can limit it (for instance, DTLS).
- Use state-of-the-art security mechanisms:
  - The architecture is based on asymmetric cryptography using strong algorithms (preferably ECC) and possibly tokens for fine-grained authorization. 
- Rollback attacks must be prevented:
  - Prevented via manifest element sequence number. For each targeted class of devices, the sequence number of updates must be monotonically increasing (also version numbers?)
- High reliability:
  - This is an implementation specific requirement, however the storage element of the manifest aids in achieving safe storage of a new image.
  - After a successful update, devices are to re-register at servers. No acknowledgement means the server knows the update still must be applied, thus an interrupted update can be redistributed.
- Operate with a small bootloader:
  - The thesis suggests to store an unencrypted image alongside its digest for the bootloader to be minimal, only needing support for SHA256.
  - All information about whether or not to perform the update is encoded in conditions in the manifest, and can be stored with minimal memory usage.
- Small parsers:
  - The manifest format used in the thesis is minimal while still complying with SUIT, easily parsed, and extensible for extra functionality.
- Minimal impact on existing firmware formats:
  - The architecture makes no assumptions about firmware formats.
- Robust permissions:
  - The architecture proposes whitelists of operators and servers that device use to permit traffic.
  - Authorization tokens are suggested as a way of achieving more finely grained level of authorization, for instance for differential updates. Different deployments can or different devices in the same deployment can have different authorization configurations.
- Operating modes:
  - The architecture supports the device initiated pull model, as well as the operator initiated push model. The update server acts as a mediator between device and operator as well as a repository for images and device profiles, letting the operator query the server for device statuses.
