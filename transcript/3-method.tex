The previous chapter provided the necessary background information. The SUIT architecture
standard identifies requirements an update architecture should have but provides minimal
examples. From this standard a high-level and technology agnostic architecture can be
designed, providing information on topics such as identification, authorization, and
device life cycles. This chapter presents the proposed architecture developed by the
thesis.
