% TODO: Dedicate this to local upgrading of images Storage locations, bootloader, how
% firmware updates differs from software updates

% TODO: Discuss possibilities of decrypting, storing, and validating image. My preferred
% option is to permanently keep manifest (you have to anwyways to compare sequence
% numbers), decrypt the image once, and upon boot check the digest in the manifest. If the
% image is tampered with the digest will be wrong. How to ensure the digest is not also
% tampered with in the manifest? The manifest is much smaller, so maybe that can be kept
% encrypted? How does the device know how to decrypt it? Keeping the unencrypted image and
% its digest prevents for attacks changing just the image..
