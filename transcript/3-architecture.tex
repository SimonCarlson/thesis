This chapter presents an update architecture based on the SUIT standard. It encompasses
device management, end-to-end security for manifests and images, transportation of
manifests and images, and the lifecycle of a device. Section hm hm does ha ha

\section{Device Lifecycle}
\label{sec:device-lifecycle}
A network of IoT devices can consist of many different kinds of devices. They may contain
different components, perform different tasks, and thus have different means of
communication. This will impact how they enroll and secure safe networks and how they
communicate with a server. The server needs to know how to reach a certain device, what
protocols and security measure does a specific device handle? It is helpful to think about
the lifecycle of devices: how they enroll in a secure network, how they keep communication
with a server, and how they can be maintained for all those years they are intended to
work.

When a factory new device is installed somewhere, it needs to enroll. Enrollment can mean
two things in this context: the first meaning is to obtain some way of securely
communicating such that payloads authenticity and validity are not unknown or altered. The
second meaning is that a server providing updates must have a profile of each device so
that the server knows which device is which, which devices needs updates, and how to
contact those devices. 

Secure communication can be achieved through numerous ways. There are different secure
transport protocols today, DTLS just being one example, and communication can be secured
by either symmetric or asymmetric cryptography. The update architecture does not make
assumptions about which protocols are used, but it is necessary that manifests and images
are somehow encrypted. Symmetric encryption can be achieved through Pre-Shared Keys, or
key exchange algorithms. Assymetric encryption can be achieved through private/public key
pairs issued by a Certificate Authority. No matter the means of encryption, it is clear
the device needs a pre-shared secret, either to be used as a symmetric
encryption/decryption key or for enrolling in a PKI.

EST-coaps is an example of a private/public key enrollment protocol. In order for a device
to enroll, it must have a predetermined secret available as well as the certificate of the
Certificate Authority. If it does not have a predetermined secret, the Certificate
Authority cannot be sure they are issuing a certificate and key pair to the correct actor.
If private keys are generated on the server side, which it might because constrained
devices could prefer to save that energy as well as not being able to properly randomise
numbers, the transfer of the private key must also be protected through some means. Yet
again the predetermined secret would achieve this.

If the device is installed in a network without the certificate of at least one
Certificate Authority, it cannot be sure they certificate and keys received are actually
from the Authority. A malicious actor could intercept traffic and distribute a certificate
and key pair while knowing the private key, depending on the method used. It is clear that
a predetermined secret as well as atleast one certificate is needed for enrollment in a
PKI.

After obtaining a means of secure communication, devices must make their preferd way of
communicating known to a server. This can also be called enrollment, or registration
perhaps. When first contacted by a device, a server will authorize the device and create a
profile for it.

The device can be authorized by checking its certificate if assymetric cryptography is
used. This once again assumes the device had a predetermined secret used to obtain a
certificate from a Certificate Authority. If symmetric encryption is used instead, the
server must have a copy of the key used by the device. The server can then issue a
challenge, such as encrypting a random number N, and let the device authorize itself by
responding with the encrypted number N+1. This would prove the device is the holder of the
correct key. The symmetric encryption solution scales poorly however since keys should not
be shared between devices, and as IoT networks can consist of tens to thousands of
devices, managing keys can easily become a monumental task. Asymmetric encryption does not
face the same issue, but instead relies on a trusted authority.

When a device has been authorized a profile for that device can be built. The profile will
tell how to communicate with that device depending on what protocols it implements.
Section \ref{ssec:information-model} introduces the notion of vendor, class, and device
IDs in the manifest used to verify a device is the intended receiver of an update. These
IDs can also be used to build a profile for a device. Since the IDs pinpoint which
category of device it is, it is easy to map a hierarchy of IDs to communication
capabilities. The device must be aware of its own IDs, and thus must be shipped with a
vendor, class, and device ID. The SUIT information model does not treat these fields as
mandatory for the manifest, but they must be present on the device in order to build these
kinds of profiles. Furthermore
