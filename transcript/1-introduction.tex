\section{Background}
\gls{iot} is the notion of connecting physical objects to the
world-spanning Internet in order to facilitate services and communication both
machine-to-human and machine-to-machine. By having everything connected from everyday
appliances to vehicles to critical parts of infrastructure, computing will be ubiquitous
and the Internet of Things realized. The benefits from the IoT can range from quality of
life services, such as controlling lights and thermostats from afar, to data gathering
through wireless sensor networks, to enabling life critical operations such as monitoring
a pacemaker or traffic system. IoT is a broad definition and fits many different devices
in many different environments, what they all have in common is that they are physical and
connected devices.

The Internet of Things is expected to grow massively in the following years as devices get
cheaper and more capable. Ericsson expects the amount of IoT connections to reach 22.3
billion devices in 2024, of which the majority is short-range IoT devices
\parencite{ericsson-mobility-report}. However, cellular IoT connections are expected to
have the highest compound annual growth rate as 4G and new 5G networks enable even more
use cases for IoT devices.

In recent years the general public has become increasingly aware of digital attacks and
intrusions affecting their day to day lives. In 2016 the DNS provider Dyn was attacked by
a botnet consisting of heterogeneous IoT devices infected by the Mirai malware. Devices
such as printers and baby monitors were leveraged to launch an attack on Dyn's services
which affected sites like Airbnb, Amazon, and CNN \parencite{perlroth_2016}. Cardiac
devices implanted in patients were also discovered to be unsafe, with hackers being able
to deplete the batteries of pacemakers prematurely \parencite{hern_2017}. These cases and
many others make it clear that security in IoT is a big deal, and as IoT is expected to
grow rapidly insecure devices can cause even more problems in the future.

Security in IoT is also closely related to its business potential. According to Bain \&
Company, the largest barrier for Internet of Things adaptation is security concerns, and
customers would buy an average of 70\% more IoT devices if they were secured
\parencite{ali_bosche_ford_2018}. Despite security being lacking today in IoT, the field
is expected to grow rapidly and an increase in unsecured devices could spell disaster.
Securing IoT equipment such as printers, baby monitors, and pacemakers is imperative to
prevent future attacks. But what about the devices currently employed without security, or
devices in which security vulnerabilities are discovered after deployment? They need to be
updated and patched in order to fix these vulnerabilities, but sending a technician to
each and every of the predicted 22.3 billion devices is not feasible. They need secure and
remote updates which is a non-trivial task.

\section{Problem Statement}
There is a need for secure software and firmware updates for IoT devices as
vulnerabilities must be patched. For many IoT devices this mean patches must be applied
over long distances and possibly unreliable communication channels as sending a technician
to each and every device is unfeasible. There are non-open, proprietary solutions
developed for specific devices but no open and interoperable standard. The \gls{ietf}
\gls{suit} working group aims to define an architecture for such a mechanism without
defining new transport or discovery mechanisms \parencite{suit}. By expanding upon the
work of the SUIT group, a standardized update mechanism suitable for battery powered,
constrained, and remote IoT devices can be developed.

\subsection{Problem}
The thesis project will examine the architecture and information model proposed by SUIT in
order to create and evaluate an updating mechanism for battery powered, constrained, and
remote IoT devices with a life span exceeding five years. The update mechanism can be
considered in three parts: communication, upgrading, and device management. Communication
will happen over unreliable channels and the payloads must arrive intact and untampered
with. The upgrade mechanism itself must ensure integrity of the target image and safely
perform the upgrade with a limited amount of memory. Device management concerns managing
devices in a network and seeing which devices are in need of updates. Device management
will not be considered in this thesis.

The thesis will examine the update mechanism from the viewpoint of IoT devices running the
Contiki-NG operating system on 32-bit ARM Cortex M3 processors. A suitable public key
infrastructure developed by RISE will also be an underlying assumption for the work. The
thesis aims to investigate the problem "How can the SUIT architecture be used to provide
secure software and firmware update for the Internet of Things?".

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the thesis project is to provide an open and interoperable update mechanism
that complies with the standards suggested by the IETF SUIT working group. This will aid
other projects trying to secure their IoT devices following accepted standards.

\subsection{Goal}
The goals of the thesis are to study current solutions and technologies and then propose
lightweight end-to-end protocols that can be used when updating IoT devices. The degree
project shall deliver specifications and prototypes of the protocols in an IoT testbed, as
well as a thesis report.

\section{Methodologies}
The thesis will follow a mix of qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The SUIT group
defines some goals or constraints a suitable updating mechanism should follow, but as
their proposed architecture is agnostic of any particular technology these goals cannot be
easily quantified. It is better to regard them as qualitative properties the mechanism
should have. In addition there are some relevant measurements, such as reliability of the
communication and memory and power requirements of the updates, that can be used in an
evaluation. The quantitative part of the evaluation will follow an objective, experimental
approach, while the qualitative part will follow a interpretative approach.

\section{Risks, Consequences, and Ethics}
As IoT devices become more commonplace their security becomes more important. Incorrect or
faulty firmware or software can lead to incorrect sensor readings, a common application of
IoT devices, which in turn can lead to incorrect conclusions. This could have a large
effect on businesses such as agriculture and healthcare. Insecure communication channels
can expose confidential or personal data, something governments and international unions
are taking more seriously. 

As these devices can be connected on networks with other computers such as laptops, a
compromised IoT device can cause an attack to proliferate throughout an entire network.
This can affect other IoT devices as well as traditional computers, putting every
connected device at risk. Furthermore hacked devices can leak data to attackers and cause
service disruptions. All of these risks and more have to be accounted for as IoT is
expected to boom.

\section{Scope}
The updating mechanism can be roughly split into three parts: the actual updating or
flipping of images on the device, the transportation of the new image, and managing a
heterogeneous network of devices needing different updates at different times. This thesis
will only look at the first two parts, updating a firmware image on the device and
transportation of the image. The thesis will not be concerned with device management.
Furthermore the thesis will focus on the use case of applying an entire update to one
single device. Other use cases such as broadcasting updates or applying differential
updates will only be considered with respect to time.

\section{Outline}
% TODO: Fix numbering
Chapter two describes the theoretical background needed to understand the results of the
thesis. This includes the network protocols and operating system being used in the thesis
as well as the SUIT standard. Chapter three describes the design of the communication
protocols used in the update mechanism. Chapter four describes how the local update
mechanism works and how devices can upgrade their images. Chapter five evaluates the
developed updating mechanism and presents the results. Chapter six ends the report with a
discussion about the update mechanism and its results.
