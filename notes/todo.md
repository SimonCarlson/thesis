To do:

- [ ] Keep sketching header formats
- [ ] Expand/improve the presentation
- [x] Make sure the background of the thesis has a clear train of though (motivations for using these technologies - how do they solve problems occuring in IoT networks)
- [x] Make the introduction more fluent and explain the value in updating IoT devices remotely
- [x] Interconnecting book
  - [x] Chapter 8
  - [x] Chapter 9
  - [x] Chapter 11.2, 11.3
  - [x] Chapter 13
- [ ] Reread and improve the introduction and background
  - [ ] Maybe include CBOR? Should check if Contiki can use it first
  - [ ] Expand/add discussion on suitability of IP and web based systems for IoT
  - [ ] (Introduction) further explain security for IoT, and what challenges it faces
- [ ] Consider how to integrate EST-coaps into the mechanism
  - [ ] Does it require anything from the application?
  - [ ] Does it change conditions for key management? How do keys reach the device?
  - [ ] Further explain why it is needed (from SUIT)
- [ ] Start looking at a minimal C manifest parser
- [ ] Start looking at a JSON to CBOR converter
