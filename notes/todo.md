To do:

- [ ] ~~Keep sketching header formats~~
- [ ] ~~Expand/improve the presentation~~
- [x] Make sure the background of the thesis has a clear train of though (motivations for using these technologies - how do they solve problems occuring in IoT networks)
- [x] Make the introduction more fluent and explain the value in updating IoT devices remotely
- [x] Interconnecting book
  - [x] Chapter 8
  - [x] Chapter 9
  - [x] Chapter 11.2, 11.3
  - [x] Chapter 13
- [x] Reread and improve the introduction and background
- [ ] Consider adding section about CBOR
  - [ ] Talk to Niclas about state of CBOR in Contiki-NG
- [x] Consider how to integrate EST-coaps into the mechanism
  - [x] Read EST RFC
  - [x] Does it require anything from the application? <b>Pre-shared keys and CA certificate</b>.
  - [x] Does it change conditions for key management? How do keys reach the device? (Can use <b>predistributed certificate</b> to authenticate on EST server)
  - [x] Further explain why it is needed (from SUIT)
- [x] Fix presentation so that someone with no prior knowledge can understand what SUIT is
- [ ] Start looking at a minimal C manifest parser
- [ ] JSON to CBOR converter
  - [x] Create script that accepts version, vendor, class, device, and image that generates all mandatory fields
  - [x] Let script derive version, vendor, class, and device from an existing JSON manifest
  - [ ] Figure out how to sign it. If not EST, use whatever method for proof of concept
  - [x] Validate correctness of mandatory fields (using cbor.me perhaps?)
  - [ ] Figure out how to add options without making the entire thing clunky
- [x] Rewrite the introduction regarding device management (architecture not implementation)
  - [x] Further push understanding of standardisation - needs flexibility, details left to implementation
- [x] Install libcoap
- [x] Read ACE, talk to Ludwig about it
- [x] Chapter 2:
  - [x] Fix any mention of device management: server side will care about finding devices, what versions they are running
  - [x] Cut down CoAP section?
  - [x] Remove header figures, they are superfluous
  - [x] DTLS: maybe put less focus on records (removing code snippets) and more on the handshake? Good to understand it relies on PKI but establishes symmetric encryption
  - [x] SUIT information model: remove long table, leave details to RFC. Mention the important fields in text
  - [x] Include ACE/OAuth 2.0
- [x] Chapter 3 intro stub:
  - [x] Mention four key areas
  - [x] Briefly explain the point of the life cycle
  - [x] Briefly explain the responsibilities of the architecture
  - [x] Introduce the sections
- [x] Chapter 3 life cycle:
  - [x] Include what happens to keys/certs upon update
- [x] Chapter 3 architecture:
  - [x] Include authorization (maybe as separate figure because it will get messy otherwise)
- [x] Chapter 3 access control:
  - [ ] Is there a benchmark of how much ACE demands from a device?
- [x] Move update workflow image early in chapter 3
  - [x] When explaining the image, dive deep on each concept
    - [x] Also think in terms of what is needed to implement a certain role (what does a.n operator/server/device implementation need?)
- [x] More descriptive chapter/section titles
- [x] Think of where to introduce the manifest used in the thesis
  - [x] Stick to SUIT 100% or propose changes? Does everything make sense? No options because of easier parsing?
- [x] Show architecture instantiations with concrete use cases
  - [x] Rewrite the examples
- [x] New chapters (can be short):
  - [x] Chapter containing at least one profile (DTLS, OSCORE)
  - [x] Make the life cycle its own chapter
- [ ] Read ACE, focus on:
  - [ ] Scope
  - [x] Proof-of-possession
  - [ ] Introspection
- [x] Ask Marco about citing his input on different tokens. <b>"Just discussion, no need to cite, put me in the acknowledgements"</b>
- [x] Read a profile document to understand the scope of a profile
- [x] Manifest of the architecture
  - [x] Use SUIT manifest as described?
  - [x] Use elements described in SUIT with different structure? (What does mandatory mean?)
  - [x] Make own manifest structure? (Look at Moran's draft)
  - [x] Image of manifest format
- [x] Emphasize concepts when introduced in chapter 3
- [x] Look at the usage of the words "firmware" and "software"
  - [x] Is SUIT truly only for firmware? Do they also mean software as in applications? <b>" Firmware Image: The firmware image is a binary that may contain      the complete software of a device or a subset of it.  The firmware      image may consist of multiple images, if the device contains more      than one microcontroller.  The image may consist of a differential      update for performance reasons.  Firmware is the more universal      term.  Both terms are used in this document and are      interchangeable."</b>
- [x] Find out which parts of SUIT needs to be covered in a profile
  - [x] Which hash should be used in the manifest?
    - [ ] Can you hash with elliptic curve and get smaller digests?
  - [x] What encodings should be used for payloads?
    - [x] CBOR
  - [x] What encryption should be used for payloads?
    - [x] COSE
    - [x] COSE can be used in CoAP right guys?
    - [x] Different keys for different COSE objects? Already established asymmetric key for manifest which contains key method for image COSE object?
  - [x] Enrollment
  - [x] Authorization
  - [x] Broadcasting
    - [x] Use as segway for OSCORE
- [x] Add a page for acknowledgements
- [x] Mention the SUIT documents are internet drafts and must be considered work in progress, that they expire, and that they may change
- [x] Put all ACE information in background
- [x] Improve summaries of chapters
- [x] Put architecture, life cycle, and profiles in one methods chapter? (<b>I think it makes sense</b>)
- [x] Introduction:
  - [x] More descriptive title (maybe use a subtitle?) <b>An Internet of Things Software and Firmware Update Architecture Based on SUIT</b>
  - [x] More "scientific sources"
  - [x] Make sure it is accessible for someone who is uninitiated
  - [x] Improve research question to be more easily answerable. <b>How can the SUIT standard be applied to develop a technology agnostic and interoperable update architecture for heterogeneous networks of Internet of Things devices?</b>
- [x] Bibliography:
  - [x] Use a standard bibliography style
- [ ] Evaluation:
  - [ ] Present threats from SUIT standard, discuss if they are fulfilled
  - [ ] Mention new/other threats covered by the architecture
  - [ ] Mention security considerations from SUIT, discuss if they are fulfilled
  - [ ] Show measurements of packet drop rates, packet sizes, radio duty cycles, energy drain
    - [ ] Include wireshark captures?
  - [ ] Other IoT security concerns outside of updates
- [x] End-to-end security
  - [x] Expand discussion about issues achieveing end-to-end
  - [x] Group contexts and keys
  - [x] Remote receiving of update, local decryption at devices
  - [x] Encrypt symm key of update with asym key of device, all parts encrypted but update is only encrypted once (size considerations)
  - [x] Consider end-to-end security from update server to devices through constrained network only. Update server is trusted intermediary from the viewpoint of an operator
- [x] Fix so that long table is not repeated in list of tables
