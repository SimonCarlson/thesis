To do:

- [ ] Keep sketching header formats
- [ ] Expand/improve the presentation
- [x] Make sure the background of the thesis has a clear train of though (motivations for using these technologies - how do they solve problems occuring in IoT networks)
- [x] Make the introduction more fluent and explain the value in updating IoT devices remotely
- [x] Interconnecting book
  - [x] Chapter 8
  - [x] Chapter 9
  - [x] Chapter 11.2, 11.3
  - [x] Chapter 13
- [x] Reread and improve the introduction and background
- [ ] Consider adding section about CBOR
  - [ ] Talk to Niclas about state of CBOR in Contiki-NG
- [x] Consider how to integrate EST-coaps into the mechanism
  - [x] Read EST RFC
  - [x] Does it require anything from the application? <b>Pre-shared keys and CA certificate</b>.
  - [x] Does it change conditions for key management? How do keys reach the device? (Can use <b>predistributed certificate</b> to authenticate on EST server)
  - [x] Further explain why it is needed (from SUIT)
- [x] Fix presentation so that someone with no prior knowledge can understand what SUIT is
- [ ] Start looking at a minimal C manifest parser
- [ ] JSON to CBOR converter
  - [x] Create script that accepts version, vendor, class, device, and image that generates all mandatory fields
  - [x] Let script derive version, vendor, class, and device from an existing JSON manifest
  - [ ] Figure out how to sign it. If not EST, use whatever method for proof of concept
  - [x] Validate correctness of mandatory fields (using cbor.me perhaps?)
  - [ ] Figure out how to add options without making the entire thing clunky
- [x] Rewrite the introduction regarding device management (architecture not implementation)
  - [x] Further push understanding of standardisation - needs flexibility, details left to implementation
- [ ] Install libcoap
- [x] Read ACE, talk to Ludwig about it
- [x] Chapter 2:
  - [x] Fix any mention of device management: server side will care about finding devices, what versions they are running
  - [x] Cut down CoAP section?
  - [x] Remove header figures, they are superfluous
  - [x] DTLS: maybe put less focus on records (removing code snippets) and more on the handshake? Good to understand it relies on PKI but establishes symmetric encryption
  - [x] SUIT information model: remove long table, leave details to RFC. Mention the important fields in text
  - [x] Include ACE/OAuth 2.0
- [x] Chapter 3 intro stub:
  - [x] Mention four key areas
  - [x] Briefly explain the point of the life cycle
  - [x] Briefly explain the responsibilities of the architecture
  - [x] Introduce the sections
- [x] Chapter 3 life cycle:
  - [x] Include what happens to keys/certs upon update
- [x] Chapter 3 architecture:
  - [x] Include authorization (maybe as separate figure because it will get messy otherwise)
- [x] Chapter 3 access control:
  - [ ] Is there a benchmark of how much ACE demands from a device?
- [x] Move update workflow image early in chapter 3
  - [ ] When explaining the image, dive deep on each concept
    - [ ] Also think in terms of what is needed to implement a certain role (what does an operator/server/device implementation need?)
- [x] More descriptive chapter/section titles
- [ ] Think of where to introduce the manifest used in the thesis
  - [ ] Stick to SUIT 100% or propose changes? Does everything make sense? No options because of easier parsing?
- [x] Show architecture instantiations with concrete use cases
  - [ ] Rewrite the examples
- [ ] New chapters (can be short):
  - [ ] Chapter containing at least one profile (DTLS, OSCORE)
  - [ ] Make the life cycle its own chapter
- [ ] Read ACE, focus on:
  - [ ] Scope
  - [ ] Proof-of-possession
  - [ ] Introspection
